## Start using the plugin

You need to connect the components and insert them in the right place in the code and enable the necessary options in the plugin settings

```bash
{% component 'META' %}
```

If you have a custom model that you want to generate the links from, add the full class name of your model in the "Sitemap" tab of the **CMS page**.
If the page has the `blogPost` component, you don't need to set the Model class.

**Important!**: Make sure that all the necessary parameters are enabled on the settings page.
